# Hack4Women

## We are making this project for the "Hack For Woman" GIRLSCRIPT INDIA SUMMIT 2020 Hackathon

We are building a website where we will connect these rural women to the consumers directly without any intermediate traders.
We will have a database of all those women who want to sell their product to the market, and then the consumers can directly connect
to them, by locating their positions using the MAP APIs.
